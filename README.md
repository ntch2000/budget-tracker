## Usage

To utilize this application, go to the application link provided to view the main page. This page will have a list of recent transactions and a graph of those transactions. Users can enter a transaction and click either "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" to indicate a deposit or withdraw. These transactions will then be added to the database and graph accordingly.

This application can also work offline. If the application looses connectivity, transactions will be added to the IndexDB "pending" database. Once connectivity is restored, the transactions will be added to the MONGODB database.

Finally, because this is a Progressive Web Application (PWA), the application can be downloaded to the user's device. This will allow the user to run the application without the need to utilize their browser.
